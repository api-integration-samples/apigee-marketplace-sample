# Apigee Data Marketplace Sample
This project offers a sample marketplace frontend application for Apigee to offer publishing & subscription user flows for data, AI & API products. This is only a demo to show what is possible using the **Headless API Distribution** engine in Apigee (supporting any type of frontend framework). In this case the marketplace app uses [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) as the frontend framework.

## Open source libraries used
- [Svelte-JSON Editor](https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor) - awesome JSON editor svelte control.
- [Rapidoc](https://rapidocweb.com/) - very nice Open API spec documentation web element that is used for API docs.
